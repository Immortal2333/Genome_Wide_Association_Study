## Data preparation
**Input Data**
* WGS data: `.R1.fastq.gz` and `.R2.fastq.gz`
* VCF File

**Dependency**
The detials of all tools can be available in their **offical website** as followed and most of them can quickly install using [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/):
* [VCFtools](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/vcftools), [PLINK2.0](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/plink2), [GEMMA](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/gemma)
